The goal of this mod is to replace shirt textures to provide a more cohesive look for the character. 

At the moment, the three characters have good designs. The Cyber Sleuth protagonists (collectively Aiba, seperately Takumi and Ami) are especially striking with the yellow and black primary colors and red and blue accents. The Hacker's Memory protagonist (Keisuke) uses a more understated palette of blue, black, and white. A dark red plaid shirt, or a dark green shirt, with bright fuzzy graphics is going to look pretty bad. More appropriate shirts will pull colors from the existing character designs, and graphics will need to stay simple and strong to match the existing symbols present in the designs. 

Version 1.0.0: 
* Organize files. I've never modded a game before.
* Establish workflow. I've never modded a game before.
* Replace the Akiba F. T-shirt. This shirt is so ugly, its existance inspired the creation of this mod.
* Extract shirt's shading. If the shading can be isolated it can be applied to original shirt designs.
* Shift colors of existing shirts. A number of shirts with simple colors and graphics can be greatly improved by just messing with the shirt's hue to match the existing color palettes. Changed Japan Tee (Blossoms), Lost Skull T-Shirt, & Twin Skills T-Shirt.

0.1.0
* Marked a lot of textures to see how they appear on the models.

Future Goals: 
* Remove most of the yellow from Aiba's legs. The sad reality is that the yellow is so bright that it overpowers the shirt unless the shirt it also yellow & black. Making the legs black, will allow more flexibility with shirt choices. 
* Edit shirts for Keisuke. I havn't played Hacker's Memory so I have opted not to touch Keisuke yet. In general he's a lower priority because his existing design is more flexible.  
* Investigate adding seperate clothing options. At the moment the mod only replaces existing textures. 
* Investigate linking shirt choices with seperate textures for the rest of the character. At the moment, most alternate shirts refer to a single set of alternate textures for the rest of the character. 
* Acquire wireframe overlays. Information on how the texture is mapped to the model's wireframe would help line up seams in the textures.
